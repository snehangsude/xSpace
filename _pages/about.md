Hi, Iâ€™m Snehangsu De. I am a Data Analyst based in India. I love working with data while creating aesthetic, sometimes interactive data visualizations. The idea is to make decision making easier with the use of data and provide insights into the story, the data tells us. Normally, I work with Python, while recently I'm also diving into the Julia programming language.

This blog contains Notebooks, few topics which I write about are below:

-    Kaggle Notebooks
-    Tree-based modelling notebooks
-    Deep Learning Notebooks
-    Miscellaneous, which normally contains tougher concepts explained in code format.

I have an additional blog in Hashnode, you can find it [here](https://xspace.hashnode.dev/).This contains hard to understand concepts explained in a visual way.

Additionally, you can view my website [here](https://snehangsude.github.io/), which contains my public projects.
